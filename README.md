## Introduction

Welcome to my blog and toolkit focused on the exploration of techniques used in malware development and analysis. Inspired by resources like MalDev Academy and Vx Underground, this repository contains a collection of blog posts (Markdown format), code samples, and tools covering a wide range of malware-related topics.

## Blog Posts

The blog posts delve into areas such as:

* **Malware Fundamentals:** Understanding the basics of malware, including types, propagation methods, and common payloads.
* **Code Injection:** Techniques like DLL injection, process hollowing, and APC injection.
* **Persistence:** Methods malware uses to maintain a presence on a system, such as registry keys, scheduled tasks, and startup folders.
* **Anti-Analysis:** Evasion techniques employed to hinder analysis, including obfuscation, anti-debugging, and anti-virtualization.
* **Network Communication:** How malware communicates with command-and-control servers, exfiltrates data, and downloads additional payloads.
* **Reverse Engineering:** Tools and techniques for analyzing malware binaries to understand their behavior and capabilities.

## Tools

The toolkit includes various scripts and utilities to aid in malware analysis and research:

* **Shellcode Analysis:** Tools for decoding, disassembling, and analyzing shellcode.
* **Process Monitoring:** Utilities to monitor process creation, termination, and network activity.
* **Memory Dumping:** Scripts to dump the memory of a running process for analysis.
* **Network Packet Capture:** Tools for capturing and analyzing network traffic.
